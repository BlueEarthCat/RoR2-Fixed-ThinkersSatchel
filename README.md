# Tinker's Satchel

A mod for Risk of Rain 2. Built with BepInEx and R2API.

Adds items and artifacts to the game, all of which may or may not be a little weird.

This project is to fix the phenomenon of a teleporter item disappearing if someone is dead during a teleporter event in multiplayer.

## Installation

Release builds are published to Thunderstore: https://thunderstore.io/package/ThinkInvis/TinkersSatchel/

**Use of a mod manager is recommended**. If not using a mod manager: extract ThinkInvis-TinkersSatchel-[version].zip into your BepInEx plugins folder such that the following path exists: `[RoR2 game folder]/BepInEx/Plugins/ThinkInvis-TinkersSatchel-[version]/TinkersSatchel.dll`.
Installation of TILER2 is also required: https://thunderstore.io/package/ThinkInvis/TILER2/

## Building

Building Tinker's Satchel locally will expect TILER2 and ClassicItems to be built in parallel solution folders. If this is not the case, you will need to specify the reference path to these DLLs manually.
