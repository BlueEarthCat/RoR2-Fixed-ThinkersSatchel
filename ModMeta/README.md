# Tinker's Satchel

## SUPPORT DISCLAIMER

### Use of a mod manager is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.

Seriously, use a mod manager.

If the versions of Tinker's Satchel or TILER2 (or possibly any other mods) are different between your game and other players' in multiplayer, things WILL break. If TILER2 is causing kicks for "unspecified reason", it's likely due to a mod version mismatch. Ensure that all players in a server, including the host and/or dedicated server, are using the same mod versions before reporting a bug.

**While reporting a bug, make sure to post a console log** (`path/to/RoR2/BepInEx/LogOutput.log`) from a run of the game where the bug happened; this often provides important information about why the bug is happening. If the bug is multiplayer-only, please try to include logs from both server and client.

## Description

This is a collection of items -- and maybe artifacts at some point in the future -- which sprung from me thinking "hey, what if...?," writing the idea in a file, and forgetting about it (until now).

### Current Additions

#### Tier-1 Item

- Mostly-Tame Mimic: "Mimics your other items at random."
	- Each individual stack has a small chance over time to switch which item it's mimicking.

#### Lunar Equipment

- Silver Compass: "Shows you a path... but it will be fraught with danger."
	- Pings the Teleporter and adds TWO stacks of Challenge of the Mountain, only ONE of which will count towards extra rewards.

## Issues/TODO

- Items have no DisplayRules.
- Jigglebones on Mimic lid (and a less half-assed model) may happen eventually.
- Mimic usually displays a count of 0 in chat pickup announcements; might also not count towards logbook stat tracker.
- See the GitHub repo for more!

## Changelog
